Bonus Goals


Ensure your app is fully mobile responsive.

Allow users to request additional gifs to be added to the page.


Each request should ADD 10 gifs to the page, NOT overwrite the existing gifs.


List additional metadata (title, tags, etc) for each gif in a clean and readable format.
Integrate this search with additional APIs such as OMDB, or Bands in Town. Be creative and build something you are proud to showcase in your portfolio

Allow users to add their favorite gifs to a favorites section.


This should persist even when they select or add a new topic.
If you are looking for a major challenge, look into making this section persist even when the page is reloaded(via localStorage or cookies).
